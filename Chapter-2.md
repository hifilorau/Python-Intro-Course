- Chapter 2: Variables and Operators

In this chapter, we will dive into variables and operators in Python, while comparing them with their JavaScript counterparts. Understanding these differences will make it easier for you to transition between the two languages.

2.1 Variables

In Python, you don't need to declare a variable before using it. You can simply assign a value to a variable, and Python will automatically infer its type. Variable names in Python must start with a letter or an underscore and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

In JavaScript:

```javascript

let number = 42;
const message = "Hello, World!";
```



In Python:

```python

number = 42
message = "Hello, World!"
```



Note that in Python, there's no need for semicolons at the end of a line.

2.2 Arithmetic Operators

Python and JavaScript share many arithmetic operators, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here's a comparison of arithmetic operators in both languages:OperatorPythonJavaScriptAdditiona + ba + bSubtractiona - ba - bMultiplicationa * ba * bDivisiona / ba / bFloor Divisiona // bMath.floor(a / b)Modulusa % ba % bExponentiationa ** bMath.pow(a, b)

2.3 Logical Operators

Logical operators

- in Python and JavaScript are similar, but there are some minor differences in syntax. Here's a comparison of logical operators in both languages:OperatorPythonJavaScriptANDa and ba && bORa or ba || bNOTnot a!a

2.4 Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. Python and JavaScript share most comparison operators, with slight differences in syntax:OperatorPythonJavaScriptEquala == ba === bNot Equala != ba !== bGreater Thana > ba > bLess Thana < ba < bGreater or Equala >= ba >= bLess or Equala <= ba <= b

2.5 Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Python and JavaScript have similar assignment operators, but Python offers some additional shorthand assignment operators:OperatorPythonJavaScriptAssignmenta = ba = bAdditiona += ba += bSubtractiona -= ba -= bMultiplicationa *= ba *= bDivisiona /= ba /= bFloor Divisiona //= b

```css

| a //= b     | N/A         |
```



| Modulus | a %= b | a %= b |
| Exponentiation | a **= b | N/A |

Note that floor division and exponentiation shorthand assignment operators are not available in JavaScript.

2.6 Type Conversion

Type conversion is a common operation in programming. Python and JavaScript have similar approaches to type conversion, but with different syntax:ConversionPythonJavaScriptTo Integerint(x)parseInt(x)To Floatfloat(x)parseFloat(x)To Stringstr(x)String(x) or x.toString()

2.7 Summary

In this chapter, we discussed variables and operators in Python and compared them with their JavaScript counterparts. You learned how to work with arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators, as well as assignment operators and type conversion.

As you continue to explore Python, you'll find that many concepts are similar to those in JavaScript, making it easier for you to transition between the two languages. In the next chapter, we will dive deeper into Python functions, helping you further understand the differences and similarities between Python and JavaScript.
